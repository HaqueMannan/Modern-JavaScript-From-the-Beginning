Section 9.1 - Iterators & Generators:

--------------------------------------
Iterators & Generators
--------------------------------------
- Iterators & Generators are both part of the ES6 standard.
- Iterators & Generators are both different but are used in similar ways i.e. both used to iterate through something.
- Iterators are kind of like advanced loops that can be paused.
- Generators are functions that can be paused and can return multiple values.
- To create a generator we must put a asterisk * after the function keyword to tell JavaScript the function is a generator for example:
   function* generatorExample


Please view the js_sandbox_9.1 folder for examples and explanation of Iterators and Generators.
