ES6 Maps
--------------------------------------
- Maps are a new object structure introduced in ES6.
- A Map is an object that holds key value pairs and any value whether its an object reference type or primitive used as a key or value.
- Maps are a constructor and we create it by setting a variable to new Map().
- You can create an empty object as a key.
