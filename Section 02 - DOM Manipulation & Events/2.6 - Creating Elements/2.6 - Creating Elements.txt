2.6. Creating Elements:

--------------------------------------
Creating Elements & Element Properties
--------------------------------------
In this section we will look at creating an element and then adding extra classes, id and attributes etc. to the new element. Essential we can create a new element and insert it into the DOM. We are going to explore this concept in this section by adding in a new/extra li list element/item to our list using JavaScript.

Please refer to the js_sandbox_2.6 folder for examples and explanations on this section.

Note: To view the creation and adding values to the element within the app.js file:
1) Comment out the whole code except for the create element and console.log. Step through each code by uncomment the code and viewing the output in the browser's JavaScript console.
