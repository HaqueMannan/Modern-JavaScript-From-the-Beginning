Section 1.4. Data Types:

--------------------------------------
Data Types in JavaScript
--------------------------------------
There are a bunch of different data types but there are two types of data types:
- Primitive Data Types
- Reference Data Types


--------------------------------------
Primitive Data Types
--------------------------------------
- Stored directly in the location the variable accesses.
- Stored on the stack 
When you access a primitive data type you access it by its actual value.

6 Primitive Data Types:
1) String - sequence of characters.
2) Number - a number (integers, decimals, floats are all consindered as numbers).
3) Boolean - true or false (1 or 0).
4) Null - intentional empty value.
5) Undefined - a variable that has not been assigned a value.
6) Symbols (ES6).


--------------------------------------
Reference Data Types
--------------------------------------
- Objects accessed by reference
- Objects that are stored on the heap
- A pointer to a location in memory
The data isn't actually stored in the variable its stored in what is called the heap (to do with dynamically allocated memory - advanced topic to research after you have a grasp of the JavaScript language).

Reference Data Types are not accessed by the actual (primitve) value, they are accessed by reference. They are also considered as objects.

5 Reference Data Types:
- Arrays
- Object Leterals
- Functions
- Dates
- Anything else


--------------------------------------
Dynamically Typed Language
--------------------------------------
- Types are associated with values not variables.
- The same variable can hold multiple types (e.g. variable can hold a string then set to a number without any errors or issues).
- We do not need to specify types.
- Most other languages are statically typed (Java, C#, C++).
- There are superets of JavaScript and addons to allow static typing (TypScript, Flow).
