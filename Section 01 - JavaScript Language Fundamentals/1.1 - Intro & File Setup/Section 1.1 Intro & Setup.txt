Section 1.1. Introduction & Setup:

--------------------------------------
Sandbox Environment
--------------------------------------
The js_sandbox folder contains 2 files:
1. index.html
2. app.js

This is our default sandbox environment that we will use throughout this course when we learn the fundementals of JavaScript.


--------------------------------------
Connecting JavaScript to HTML Document
--------------------------------------
There are two methods in which we can connect our JavaScript code to our html document:
1. Internally within our html file.
2. Externally by creating a .js file and adding a link within our html file.


--------------------------------------
Examples:
--------------------------------------
Method 1 - Script tags within HTML docuemnt (Internal):
   <script>
      //Insert JavaScript code directly e.g. 
      alert("Hello");
   </Script>

Method 2 - Script source tag linking to a external .js file (External):
   <script src:"app.js"></script>

[Note: if the app.js was in another folder called js we would have to write "js/app.js"]


--------------------------------------
Final Note:
--------------------------------------

It is recommended to avoid Method 1 unless it is one or two lines of JavaScript code being used. We will be using Method 2 throughout this course when we write our JavaScript code.
