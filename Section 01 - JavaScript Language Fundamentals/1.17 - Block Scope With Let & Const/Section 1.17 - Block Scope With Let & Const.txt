Section 1.17. Block Scope With Let & Const:

--------------------------------------
Block Scope With Let & Const
--------------------------------------
You should now know about functions, if statements and loops. In this section we will be looking at scope and Let & Const vs Var.

Global Scope means that you are not within anything i.e any functions, if statements or loops.

Function Scope is code within the function.

Variables created in the Global Scope are seen as different from the variables created in the Function Scope - please refer to the js_sandbox_1.17 folder for demonstration.

Block Scope means you are within a if statement, loop etc. (anything wrapped within curly braces).

VAR - Block Scope variable value (if the variable shares the same name as the Global Scope var variable) will change the Global Scope var variable value.
LET & CONST - Block Scope variable value will not affect the Global Scope let and const variable value (variable with the same name in Global and Block scope) - please refer to the js_sandbox_1.17 folder for demonstration.

LET & CONST have a Block Level Scope whereas VAR has a Function Level Scope.
