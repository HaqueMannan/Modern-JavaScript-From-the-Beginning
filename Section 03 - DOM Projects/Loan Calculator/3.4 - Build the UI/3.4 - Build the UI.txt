- Creating a single form UI app.
- Using Bootstrap v4.0 CDN
- Bootstrap 4 Starter Template as base HTML - includes Bootstrap CDN & JavaScript file for Bootstrap and 2 dependencies: jQuery & PopperJS.
- img folder container loader .gif image to be used as UX later.

Bootstrap HTML Layout:
- using Bootstrap CSS to add a dark background to the body.
- Added Bootstrap container to add auto margin on the sides.
- using grid system inside the container div, adding a 6 column grid and using class to auto margin to centre the content.
- Finally we will create a card inside the div element for our content.
- We then add headings and the fields for the loan calculator.
