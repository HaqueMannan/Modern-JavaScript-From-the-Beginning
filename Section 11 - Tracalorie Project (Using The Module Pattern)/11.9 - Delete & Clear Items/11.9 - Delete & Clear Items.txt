--------------------------------------
ItemCtrl Controller:
- Added deleteItem and clearAllItems functions in the public method.
- deleteItem will remove the item that matches the id that is passed in as a parameter which is the currentItem id. This will remove the item from the data structure.
- clearAllItems will clear the whole list by setting the data.item to an empty array.


UICtrl Controller:
- Added clearBtn to the UISelector to record the id/class name of the html element.
- Added deleteListItem and removeItems functions to the public method. This will remove the item-id from the list items using the .remove() method.


App Controller:
- Added event listeners on the click event on the following buttons to call the following events/functions:
   > deleteBtn - itemDeleteSubmit
   > backBtn - UICtrl.clearEditState
   > clearBtn - clearAllItemsClick
- We created a function that would take in the e event object so that when we call on UICtrl.clearEditState first and the prevent the default button behaviour of the page refreshing itself.
