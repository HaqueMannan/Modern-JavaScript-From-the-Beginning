Section 4.5. Using Object.create:

--------------------------------------
Using Object.create
--------------------------------------
- This section will explore an alternative way of creating an object using something called Object.create.
- We can create prototype inside of a kind of parent object and then have different properties with different prototype methods/prototype functions.

- Please view the js_sandbox_4.5 folder for examples of using the Object.create to create objects and prototypes.

- Step 1 create a parent function that is a object with the different prototype methods.
- Step 2 create a variable to create a new object using the Object.create() passing in the parent function created in step 1.
- Step 3 - add properties to the new object. There are two syntax for this:

   x.firstName = 'John'
   x.lastName = 'Doe'
or
   firstName: {value: 'John'},
   lastName: {value: 'Doe'}

- Step 4 we can also call on the prototype methods on these objects as you normally would do for example:

   console.log(x.greeting());
