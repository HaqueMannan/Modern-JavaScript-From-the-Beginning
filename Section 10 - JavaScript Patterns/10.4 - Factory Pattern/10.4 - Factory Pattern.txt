Factory Pattern
--------------------------------------
- Factory Pattern (also known as factory method) is a way of creating interface for creating objects but we can let sub classes to define which classes to instantiate.
- Often used to manage, maintain and manipulate collections of objects that are different but at the same time have many common characteristics for example a member/membership.
- It is really useful when you have different objects but they share alot of the same properties and methods.

- Please refer to the js_sandbox_10.4 folder for example of Factory Pattern.
