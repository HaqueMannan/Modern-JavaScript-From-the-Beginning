--------------------------------------
Book List - Build UI - index.html

- Using Skeleton.css framework

- CSS in html, not best practice but because we have very little CSS it is OK to add in the html file.

- Container to centre content of application with auto padding to the left and right.
- Simple UI of Form fields and submit button
- Simple UI of Table to display book data.
- The <tbody id="book-list"></tbody> will have no content, but we will use the id 'book-list' to dynamically add data in the body tags of added books.
