Section 8.3. Regular Expressions [Part 2] - Metacharacter Symbols:

--------------------------------------
Regular Expressions - Metacharacter Symbols
--------------------------------------
- Regular Expression strings must be contained within two forward slashes to create a Expression Literal for example:
   /Hello/;

- Regular Expression are case sensitive. To make a regular expression case insensitive we would use the i flag after the closing forward slash for example:
   /Hello/i;


- There are many different meta-characters symbols we can use within our regular expression string which have different results for example (this is not an exhaustive list):

Symbol            Expression
^                 Must start with
$                 Must end with
^ $               Must begin and end with
.                 Matches any ONE character
*                 Matches any character 0 or more times
?                 Optional character
\                 Escape characters

Examples:
Expression           Description
/^h/i;               Must start with h
/ d$/i;              Must end with d
/^hello$/i;          Must start with h and end with o
/H.llo/i;            Matches any one character i.e. Hillo or HÂ£llo etc. would return true.
/H*llo/i;            Matches any character 0 or more times i.e. Heeello or Hllo would return true.
/Gre?y?/i;           The character before the ? symbol is an optional character i.e. e and y are optional.
/Grey\?/i;           Escape character used so we want to match Grey? including the question mark.
