Section 6.2. Ajax & XHR Introduction

--------------------------------------
Ajax & XHR Introduction
--------------------------------------
- Ajax stands for Asynchronous JavaScript & XML
- Ajax is not a language or framework or a library, rather it is a set of web technologies to send and receive data from the client and server and it does this Asynchronously. This is done behind the scene without having to explicitly reload the web page.
- JSON has replaced XML for the most part and XML is hardly used in Ajax. Most of the API we will be working with will return JSON data and not XML. Ajax can work with both JSON, XML as well as plain text.

                     CLIENT (YOU)
            -------------------------------------

- The server is the application or web page we are looking at while the client is the client computer/browser.
- Usually we would type in a URL or we would click on a link in a browser and that would send a common Http request from the client to the server and we would get a common response back from the server to the client. We would ask for everything and we would get everything.
- Ajax allows us to make a request asynchronously and this is done behind the scenes in the background without having to reload or refresh the entire web page e.g. we can update one section of text using Ajax which is much faster, rather than refreshing the whole page. This also makes things more interactive.
- We would make a asynchronous JavaSript call which goes through something called a AJAX engine and uses the XmlHttpRequest (XHR) object which is part of the browser.
- The server returns data usually in JSON format but can also be in XML or plain text. We use that data in our application.
- This is all done behind the scene without any page refresh.


--------------------------------------
XmlHttpRequest (XHR) Object
--------------------------------------
- Core technology in Ajax and provided by the browser's JavaScript environment (all browsers have this API).
- Its methods transfers data between client and server.
- Can be used with other protocols other than HTTP (HTTP is the most common).
- Can work with data other than XML (e.g. JSON, plain text).

libraries & Other Methods
--------------------------------------
Internal Libraries:
   - Fetch API (part of the browser and core JavaScript)
External Libraries:
   - Axios
   - Superagent
   - jQuery (advised not to use for Ajax because bloated and a complete DOM manipulation library)
   - Node HTTP
   - Other
