Section 6.7. Callback Functions:

--------------------------------------
Callback Functions
--------------------------------------
- A callback function is simply a function that is passed in as a parameter to another function and then it's run in the function body.
- We have synchronous and asynchronous callbacks functions (e.g. setTimeout uses asynchronous callback function whereas our forEach loops in previous sections used synchronous callback functions).

Please refer to the js_sandbox_6.7 folder for example and commentary of the callback() functions. In the app.js file we mimic a server and database application for a blog post. This will demonstrate essentially how callback function works (a function that can be passed into another function and then called within that function).
