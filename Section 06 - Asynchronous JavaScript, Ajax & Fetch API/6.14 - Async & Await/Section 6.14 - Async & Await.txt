Section 6.14. Async & Await:

--------------------------------------
Async & Await
--------------------------------------
- We are going to look at a feature called Async Await which is part of ES7 (ES2016) standard but it is fully implemented in Chrome.
- If you are going to use this feature in production you may wish to compile your code down to ES5 (using webpack & babel) to make sure it works in all browsers.

Please view the js_sandbox_6.14 folder for example and commentary on the Async & Await ES7 feature.
